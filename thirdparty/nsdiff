=head1 NAME

nsdiff - create "nsupdate" script from DNS zone file differences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

nsdiff [B<-hV>] [B<-b> I<address>] [B<-k> I<keyfile>] [B<-y> [I<hmac>:]I<name>:I<key>]
       [B<-0>|B<-1>] [B<-q>|B<-v> [q][r]] [B<-cdD>] [B<-i> I<regex>] [B<-S> I<mode>|I<num>]
       [B<-u>] [B<-s> I<server>] [B<-m> I<server>] <I<zone>> [I<old>] [I<new>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<nsdiff> program examines the F<old> and F<new> versions of a DNS
zone, and outputs the differences as a script for use by BIND's
B<nsupdate> program. It ignores DNSSEC-related differences, assuming
that the name server has sole control over zone keys and signatures.

The input files are typically in standard DNS master file format. They
are passed through BIND's B<named-compilezone> program to convert them
to canonical form, so they may also be in BIND's "raw" format and may
have F<.jnl> update journals.

If the F<old> file is not specified, B<nsdiff> will use B<dig> to transfer
the zone from the server given by the B<-s> option, or if the B<-s> option
is missing it will get the server from the zone's SOA MNAME field. If both
F<old> and F<new> files are not specified, B<nsdiff> will transfer the new
version of the zone from the server given by the B<-m> option.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h>

Display this documentation.

=item B<-V>

Display version information.

=item B<-0>

Allow very large updates affecting one domain name to be split across
multiple requests.

=item B<-1>

Abort if update does not fit in one request packet.

=item B<-c>

Compare records case-insensitively. Can be helpful if the B<nsupdate>
target server does not preserve the case of domain names. However with
this option, B<nsdiff> does not correctly handle records that only
differ in case.

=item B<-D>

Do not ignore DNSKEY records. It is sometimes necessary to take manual
control over a zone's DNSKEY RRset, for instance to include a foreign
DNSKEY records during migration to or from another hosting provider.
If you use this option your un-signed zone file should include the
complete DNSKEY RRset; if not, nsdiff will try to delete the DNSKEY
records. Normally B<named> will reject the update, unless the zone is
configured with the I<dnssec-secure-to-insecure> option.

=item B<-d>

Ignore DS records. This option is useful if you are managing secure
delegations on the signing server (via nsupdate) rather than in the
source zone.

=item B<-i> I<regex>

Ignore more DNS records. By default, B<nsdiff> strips out DNSSEC RRs
(except for DS) before comparing zones. You can exclude irrelevant
changes from the diff by supplying a I<regex> that matches the
unwanted RRs.

=item B<-m> I<server>[#I<port>]

Transfer the new version of the zone from the server given in this option,
for example, a back-end hidden master server. You can specify the server
host name or IP address, optionally followed by a "#" and the port number.

=item B<-s> I<server>[#I<port>]

Transfer the old version of the zone from the server given in this option,
using the same syntax as the B<-m> option.

=item B<-S> B<date>|B<master>|B<serial>|B<unix>|I<num>

Choose the SOA serial number update mode: the default I<master> takes
the serial number from the I<new> input zone; I<date> uses a number of
the form YYYYMMDDnn and allows for up to 100 updates per day;
I<serial> just increments the serial number in the I<old> input zone;
I<unix> uses the UNIX "seconds since the epoch" value. You can also
specify an explicit serial number value. In all cases, if the I<old>
input zone serial number is larger than the target value it is just
incremented. Serial number wrap-around is not supported.

=item B<-q>

Quiet / quick check. Output is suppressed unless the zones differ, in
which case a short note is printed instead of an B<nsupdate> script.

=item B<-u>

Tell B<nsupdate> to send the update message to the server specified in the
B<-s> option.

=item B<-v> [q][r]

Control verbosity.
The B<q> flag causes queries to be printed.
The B<r> flag causes responses to be printed.
To make B<nsdiff> quiet, use S<B<-v ''>>.

=back

The following options are passed to B<dig> to modify its SOA and AXFR
queries:

=over

=item B<-b> I<address>

Source address for B<dig> queries

=item B<-k> I<keyfile>

TSIG key file for B<dig> queries.

=item B<-y> [I<hmac>:]I<name>:I<key>

Literal TSIG key for B<dig> queries.

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

The B<nsdiff> utility returns 0 if the zones are the same, 1 if they
differ, and 2 if there was an error.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<usage: ...>

=item C<not a domain name: I<E<lt>zoneE<gt>>>

Errors in the command line.

=item C<could not get SOA record for I<E<lt>zoneE<gt>>>

Failed to retreive the zone's SOA using B<dig> when trying to obtain
the server MNAME from which to AXFR the zone.

=item C<missing SOA record>

The output of B<named-compilezone> is incomplete,
usually because the input file is erroneous.

=item C<I<E<lt>zoneE<gt>> has changes>

Printed instead of an B<nsupdate> script when the B<-q> option is
used.

=item C<update does not fit in packet>

The changes for one domain name did not fit in 64 KiB, or the B<-1>
option was specified and all the changes did not fit in 64 KiB.

=item C<ignoring dig options when loading zones from files>

Warning emitted when the command line includes options for B<dig>
as well as zone source files.

=item C<ignoring -m option when loading new zone from file>

=item C<need -m option when there are no input files>

The B<-m> I<master> option is required when there are no file arguments,
and ignored otherwise.

=item C<loading zone I<E<lt>zoneE<gt>> via AXFR from I<server>>

=item C<loading zone I<E<lt>zoneE<gt>> from file I<file>>

Normal progress messages emitted before B<nsdiff> invokes
B<named-compilezone>, to explain the latter's diagnostics.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE - DNSSEC

It is easiest to deploy DNSSEC if you allow B<named> to manage zone keys
and signatures automatically, and feed in changes to zones using DNS
update requests. However this is very different from the traditional way
of manually maintaining zones in standard master file format. The
B<nsdiff> program bridges the gap between the two operational styles.

To support this workflow you need BIND-9.7 or newer. You will continue
maintaining your zone master file C<$sourcefile> as before, but it is no
longer the same as the C<$workingfile> used by B<named>. After you make
a change, instead of using C<rndc reload $zone>, run C<nsdiff $zone
$sourcefile | nsupdate -l>.

Configure your zone as follows, to support DNSSEC and local dynamic updates:

  zone $zone {
    type master;
    file "$workingfile";
    auto-dnssec maintain;
    update-policy local;
  };

To create DNSSEC keys for your zone, change to named's working directory
and run these commands:

  dnssec-keygen -f KSK $zone
  dnssec-keygen $zone

=head1 EXAMPLE - bump-in-the-wire signing

A common arrangement for DNSSEC is to have a master server that is
oblivious to DNSSEC, a signing server which transfers the zone from the
master and adds the DNSSEC records, and a number of slave servers which
transfer the zone from the signer and which are the public authoritative
servers.

You can implement this with B<nsdiff>, which handles the transfer of the
zone from the master to the signer. No modifications to the master are
necessary. You set up the signer as in the previous section. To transfer
changes from the master to the signer, run the following on the signer:

  nsdiff -m $master -s $signer $zone | nsupdate -l

=head1 EXAMPLE - dynamic reverse DNS

You have a reverse zone such as C<2.0.192.in-addr.arpa> which is
mostly managed dynamically by a DHCP server, but which also has some
static records (for network equipment, say). You can maintain the
static part in a master file and feed any changes into the live
dynamic zone by telling B<nsdiff> to ignore the dynamic entries. Say
all the static equipment has IP addresses between 192.0.2.250 and
192.0.2.255, then you can run the command pipeline:

  nsdiff -i '^(?!25\d\.)' 2.0.192.in-addr.arpa 2.0.192.static |
    nsupdate -l

=head1 CAVEATS

By default B<nsdiff> does not maintain the transactional semantics of
native DNS update requests when the diff is big: it applies large changes
in multiple update requests. To minimise the problems this may cause,
B<nsdiff> ensures each domain name's changes are all in the same update
request. There is still a small risk of clients not seeing a change applied
atomically when that matters (e.g. altering an MX and creating the new
target in the same transaction). You can avoid the risk by using the B<-1>
option to prevent multi-packet updates, or by being careful about changes
that depend on multiple domain names.

The update requests emitted by B<nsdiff> include SOA serial number
prerequisite checks to ensure that the zone has not changed while it is
running. This can happen even in simple setups if B<named> happens to be
re-signing the zone at the time you make an update. Unfortunately the DNS
update protocol does not allow for good error reporting when a prerequisite
check fails. You can use B<nspatch> to cope with this problem.

=head1 BUGS

When updating a name's DNS records, B<nsdiff> first deletes the old
ones then adds the new ones. This ensures that CNAME replacements and
TTL changes work correctly. However, this update strategy prevents you
from replacing every record in a zone's apex NS RRset in one update,
because it isn't possible to delete all a zone's name servers.
